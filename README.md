# ₊‧°𐐪 beary nice to meet you 🧸 my name is jena 𐑂°‧₊

im just another front-end dev that cant say no to coffee (and boba). i currently work in the financial industry.

this is where i'll keep my personal projects so i can separate them from my professional work.

currently working on a glucose journal dedicated to my partner with diabetes.

other projects i have planned/am working on:
  - daily lip tint recommender (for my fellow k-beauty lovers)
  - aircraft name generator (because i like listening to my dad talk about airplanes)

i have a lot of weird ideas for apps and i just like to make things, so anything i come up with will most likely have a repo here! <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IOLzF0Mak2I/TkndZ75Xt2I/AAAAAAAAAYQ/FQXsCXSWbuQ/s1600/20100413204011c69.gif" width="18px" height="18px" />
