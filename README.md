₊‧°𐐪 beary nice to meet you 🧸 𐑂°‧₊

im just another front-end dev that cant say no to boba.

this is where i'll keep my personal projects so i can separate them from my professional work.

currently working on a glucose journal dedicated to my partner with diabetes.
i also have a daily lip tint picker quiz-type app currently planned! 

i have a lot of weird ideas for apps and i just like to make things, so anything i come up with will most likely have a repo here!
